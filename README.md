A twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream.

Users need to sign up with an email and password, name and username.
They need to be able to log in and log out.
They can post messages (called peeps) and see other messages in a chronological order. (Also not anonymous - peeps show sender).
Bcrypt secures the passwords.
datamapper and postgres saves the data
deployed with heroku.
